This repo contains public documentation for Configo Insight, a configuration snapshotting and reporting product by Configo Software.

## About Configo Insight

Configo Insight is a SaaS product that:
- captures the complete state of software configuration of a supported software product;
- makes said configuration available in a predictable file structure that is fully interpreted (i.e. makes references explicit, binary data, XML and JSON inlined etc.) and searcheable;
- identifies all configuration-based issues, such as non-portable identities or unresolved references; and
- produces all configuration reports.

All these artifacts are made available for the user to download and explore offline. They are also revision control friendly and can be meaningfully versioned, allowing the user to monitor configuration changes over time both directly and, through reports, from different high-level points of view.
